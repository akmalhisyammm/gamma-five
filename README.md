## Abstract

Everyone often must face several problems, for example, the problems that are often experienced by prospective students are in determining the appropriate college major for themselves. The level of success or failure of a person in life, be it the world of work, academics, or in the community is much influenced by the behavior and personality of that person. Therefore, prospective students are recommended to determine the right college major from the beginning of entering the lecture level. Based on the problems above, we need a web-based expert system that can assist prospective students in determining college majors that suit their personality. The purpose of developing this expert system is to build an expert system that can determine college majors based on the personality of prospective students, create a system that can replace the role of experts in recognizing the personality of prospective students, and apply the certainty factor method to an expert system to determine college majors based on the personality of prospective students. This website was developed using the Next.js framework with Chakra UI as the User Interface and Firebase as the database. Based on the results of the research that has been done, the development of a web-based expert system to determine college majors based on the personality of prospective students using the functional certainty factor method has worked well, where the system is able to provide recommendations for college majors that are in accordance with the personality based on tests that have been carried out by user.
